# SuggestionBot on discord.js (JavaScript, Discord Module)
A bot for suggestions written on discord.js
Absolutely free to use.
# Setup
Download the repo afterwards, install node.js from https://nodejs.org/
Then unzip the archive to C:\
Then open "setup". It will setup the discord.js version 11.5.1
After this you can open 'config.json' and insert your bot token and prefix and now we can start working with the main code.
Open 'index.js' and search for (mainly its ctrl+f) channelId here. Then replace channelId with the the channel id that you want to use.
How to find channel ID -> https://github.com/Chikachi/DiscordIntegration/wiki/How-to-get-a-token-and-channel-ID-for-Discord
Afterwards you can change the messages and the commands but on my opinion everyting there is just fine!
Thanks for using my suggestion bot!
# Use
After the setup, just open "start.bat" which will start the bot by the token you wrote in config.json
